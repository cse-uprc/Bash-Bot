# Bash-Bot
Uses the Discord.py API to run a Discord bot's instance, eventually intended to run Bash commands locally on a dedicated Linux device.

------------------------------------

# Commands
By preceding a statement with `!`, the first word of a statement is considered to be a command and every other word an operand. Any time @user is incurred, it is with reference to a particular user and will send any user who has not muted the channel or bot in question a notification. These instances exist for the sake of example and are not to be taken verbatim.
## hello
Responds to the author with "Hello @author!" in the channel the command was sent through.
## download
Downloads the first attached file sent by the user.
